## Rating Scale

| Tier | Range | Expected Performance |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Junior | 1.1–1.3 | Needs guidance on fundamentals. Misses obvious patterns. |
| Mid-Level | 2.1–2.3 | Can implement with direction. Follows patterns but doesn't see why. |
| Senior | 3.1–3.3 | Makes sound independent decisions. Explains tradeoffs. Sees downstream effects. |
| Staff | 4.1–4.3 | Sees system-wide implications. Designs for future. Identifies what NOT to build. |
| Exceptional | 5.1–5.3 | Novel solutions. Teaches others. Challenges accepted patterns productively. |

## Baseline Rules

- First 3 interactions in a category: log evidence, no rating assigned
- After 3rd interaction: set baseline rating based on the pattern across all 3
- After baseline: incremental adjustments per the Movement Rules in the learner-profile skill
