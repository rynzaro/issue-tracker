# Project Context

> **This file is generated by the `@onboarding` agent.** Run `@onboarding` in Copilot Chat to fill it in for your project. You can also edit it manually at any time.

---

## Tech Stack

_Language(s), framework(s), database, key libraries._

<!-- Example: TypeScript · Next.js 15 App Router · Prisma · PostgreSQL · Tailwind CSS · Zod -->

## Architecture Pattern

_How code flows through your system. What's the established pattern for a typical feature?_

<!-- Example: Component → Server Action → Service → Prisma -->

## Key Files

_Entry points, config files, and files that demonstrate the project's patterns._

| File                              | Purpose                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| <!-- e.g., src/app/layout.tsx --> | <!-- Root layout -->    |
| <!-- e.g., src/lib/actions/ -->   | <!-- Server actions --> |

## Code Style

_Naming conventions, formatting rules, language preferences for UI text._

<!-- Example: camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components. UI text in English. -->

## Doc Map

_Where to find project documentation. Format: Doc → "Answers the question" → Key contents._

| Doc                                 | Answers the question                        | Key contents                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| <!-- e.g., docs/ARCHITECTURE.md --> | <!-- "What are the architecture rules?" --> | <!-- Patterns, invariants --> |

## Boundaries

_Project-specific rules for the "Never" tier. These are added to the global Never list in copilot-instructions.md._

### Always Do (Project-Specific)

- <!-- e.g., Verify auth session in every server action -->
- <!-- e.g., Filter soft-deleted records in every query -->

### Never (Project-Specific)

- <!-- e.g., DB-level cascade deletes -->
- <!-- e.g., Import from internal modules outside their feature boundary -->

## Goals

_What the learner wants to improve in, and what "good code" means in this project._

<!-- Filled in during onboarding based on the interview. -->
